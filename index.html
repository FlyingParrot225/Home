            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>Let me start off by saying that the main goal of this project is to bring awareness to programming and introduce people to it. My hope is that this will spark an interest for you to at least give it a try as it can be a very useful skill to have. With that said, I will be going over what programming is, what it is used for, and finally why you should know at least the basics of it.</p>

            <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
            <p>Programming is the act of writing code that when run by a computer, it does something. It can be as simple as something like tic tac toe or as complex as a fully functioning chess AI that can think 18 moves ahead. It may sound complicated, but once you learn the basics it becomes much more manageable.</p>

            <h2>What is programming used for?</h2>
            <p>Programming is used for many different things. Even this STEAM fair project is made by code that I wrote myself. There are a few main categories that I would like to bring attention to. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Web Development</h3>
                        <p>Web development is the development of websites. There are two parts to web development and they are called the "front end" and the "back end". The front end is what you see on the website, it is also commonly refered to as the "client side". The back side is what is hidden from the user which is usually a server. Infact this project is hosted on a server. Web development is very useful and is rising in popularity as it gains more functionality. The core 3 languages for front end development are called "HTML", "CSS", and "Javascript". There are a few langauges that can be used for back end development, one of the most noteable being Python.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Software Development</h3>
                        <p>Software development is the development of applications. There are many languages that can be used to make apps. "C", "C++", "Java", and "Python" to name a few. There are many more than just those, but those are some of the most popular ones. Java is mist commonly used to make Android apps. Apple has their own language for development on Iphones called "Swift". </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                        <p>AI is a form of coding that makes a program able to interact with different situations. The most common language used for making AI is Python. AI is a very powerful tool that can be used for many different things from getting insanely high scores in the offline dino game on google chrome to predicting the shapes of protiens in the human body. There is no limit to AI if it is advanced enough, however the development of Skynet is probably far in the future and likely wont happen anytime soon.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <div class="contentContainer">
            <h2>Why Should You Get Into Programming?</h2>
            <p>You should get into programming because not only is it a useful skill, its also fun and it can also unlock many job opportunities. It can also serve as a hobby for when you are bored or a long term project that can be shared with others. FOr instance, I generally code if I'm bored or if I have a project in mind that I want to make a reality. Some of my current projects include a 2d rpg game and this website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contentContainer">
            <h2>Where should you start?</h2>
            <p>You can take many different approches to programming and can start from many different places. Personally, I would suggest that you start with Python. It is easy to set up, runs on many different devices, and can be used for many differnet things like websites, AI, and software. Of course there are some things that it cant do but it is a great starter language. There are many places you can learn a programming language. The most important ones for me are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://sololearn.com">Sololearn</a>.</p>
